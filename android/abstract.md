the creation of authentication credentials. This document describes the core
concepts of OpenYOLO, and the platform-specific details for implementing the
OpenYOLO protocol on Android.

**What's in a name?**

YOLO stands for "You Only Login Once", which was the internal code-name
for Google's [Smart Lock for Passwords][smart-lock] API on Android. OpenYOLO
is the open standard successor to YOLO - lessons learned from the
implementation and usage of Smart Lock for Passwords have heavily influenced
this specification.
