**What's in a name?**

YOLO stands for "You Only Login Once", which is the internal code-name
for Google's [Smart Lock for Passwords][smart-lock] API on Android. OpenYOLO
is the open standards successor to YOLO, and came to be as a result of an
initial collaboration between Google and [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com).
OpenYOLO leverages the lessons learned from YOLO, and also ensures that
implementations of OpenYOLO can compete on a level playing field.

OpenYOLO would not have been likely to succeed without
[AgileBits](https://agilebits.com/),
[Keeper Security](https://keepersecurity.com/)
and [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/),
to whom we are grateful for their continued support and engagement.
