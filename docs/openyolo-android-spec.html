As of 2016, users typically interact with around <a href="https://blog.dashlane.com/infographic-online-overload-its-worse-than-you-thought/">100 services</a>. Many of those services are used less than once a month, for example to buy flowers or arrange air travel. Switching to a new device is a particularly painful experience due to the need to re-authenticate with all used services.</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.p.5"><p>Remembering unique account details for 100+ services is infeasible; the natural human consequence of this situation is widespread credential reuse across services. This is a disaster for the user's security - an alternative approach is needed.</p></div><section id="password-authentication"><h3 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#password-authentication">Password authentication</a></h3><div id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1" class="avoidbreakafter"><p>Password based authentication, despite many attempts to displace it, remains the most common form of authentication in use today. Password authentication suffers from three key issues:</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2"><ul><li><div><p>User selected passwords are often <em>weak</em>. Most users do not know how to produce <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2004.81">high entropy passwords</a>. The basic strategies employed involve using combinations of common dictionary words, years and names, all of which easily succumb to social engineering and dictionary attacks.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>Password credentials are often <em>transferable</em>. The limits of humans to memorize long strings of random information is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/322796.322806">well studied</a>; the typical user cannot be expected to memorize more than 5 passwords for unrelated services. The natural consequence is that users frequently reuse their passwords, which when combined with email addresses as identifiers, makes the credentials transferable across unrelated services. If a password is uncovered for a user on one service, an attacker can simply try this credential on other services with a high success rate.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>Password credentials are often <em>long lived</em>. There is no intrinsic expiration time on a password credential, and password rotation is not uniformly enforced across all password using services. If a password is uncovered by an attacker, it can be used for a significant period of time, perhaps indefinitely.</p></div> <div><p>Even where a service does enforce password rotation, such as once a year, "digit rotation" is commonly employed by users to circumvent this: they simply increment a counter at some position in the password, typically at the end. This makes guessing future passwords from current passwords particularly easy for an attacker.</p></div><a class="self" href="#rfc.section.1.1.p.2">¶</a></li> </ul></div><div id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3" class="avoidbreakafter"><p>The problems that passwords cause only get worse as users interact with more and more services. Yet, password authentication persists:</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4"><ul><li><div><p>Password authentication is familiar to users, and is therefore is often their default choice.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>It is considered to be easy to implement, despite the numerous account system breaches that demonstrate the opposite.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>It has no dependencies on external entities, like identity providers. The stability of the system is entirely under the control of the implementer, for better or worse.</p></div><a class="self" href="#rfc.section.1.1.p.4">¶</a></li> </ul></div><div id="rfc.section.1.1.p.5"><p>It is unlikely that password based authentication can be completely displaced; as such, any solution in this problem space will have to accommodate password based authentication.</p></div></section><section id="federated-authentication"><h3 id="rfc.section.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#federated-authentication">Federated authentication</a></h3><div id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1"><p>Federated authentication, in the form of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth2</a> and <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect</a>, solves the problem of account overload by centralizing authentication for the user with a small number of trusted <em>identity providers</em>. Furthermore, by providing proof of authentication to a service (referred to as a <em>relying party</em> in this context) in the form of cryptographically signed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">ID tokens</a>, overall security is significantly improved when compared to password based authentication.</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2"><p>However, the success of federated authentication is still limited - OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are regarded as difficult to implement, and federated authentication was unnecessarily tainted by "social login" in the early 2010s. Federated authentication became associated with unnecessary and invasive sharing of personal information. This association has largely been undone, but the perception of privacy invasion lingers.</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.2.p.3"><p>Furthermore, it is easy for users to forget <em>which</em> identity provider they use, when multiple options are presented. Services also rarely implement <em>account linking</em> correctly, where multiple authentication methods are attached to the same core account. Because of this, making the wrong choice often leads to a totally different account: for example, choosing Google Sign-in when the user's account was actually created using Facebook. The inconsistency and frustration caused by this is often enough to drive users to the authentication method they know best - email and password authentication, with a reused password across every service.</p></div></section><section id="account-recovery-based-authentication"><h3 id="rfc.section.1.3"><a href="#rfc.section.1.3">1.3.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#account-recovery-based-authentication">Account recovery based authentication</a></h3><div id="rfc.section.1.3.p.1" class="avoidbreakafter"><p>An equally common method of authentication employed by users is to simply trigger the <em>account recovery</em> flow every time they need to use the service. Accounts are typically created with a recovery email address or phone number, and users exploit this fact to regain access to the account when necessary. They expect the following flow:</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.3.p.2"><ol><li><div><p>An email or SMS message will be sent containing a link to reset the password.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>The user clicks the link to change their password, likely to either their current reused password, or something else that they immediately forget.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>The user is now authenticated. When the session expires or the user changes device the process is often repeated.</p></div><a class="self" href="#rfc.section.1.3.p.2">¶</a></li> </ol></div><div id="rfc.section.1.3.p.3"><p>We shall refer to this method of authentication as "proof of access" - by demonstrating that a secret can be communicated via some trusted side-channel, the user can gain access to the account. Some services use this method explicitly, as the main form of authentication - <a href="https://www.slack.com">Slack</a> refers to this as "magic link" authentication.</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.3.p.4"><p>Sending an authentication secret (a code or a link) to an email address or phone number is essentially a form of federated authentication. In comparison to OpenID Connect, this is a rather absurd and inconvenient, as it requires the user to manually drive the authentication flow. It is, however, a model of authentication that users find easy to understand, despite its shortcomings.</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.3.p.5"><p>If it were possible to provide proof of access to an email address or phone number directly to a service from an authoritative source, then the manual verification of access to that email or phone number would be unnecessary. The most common email providers are <em>also</em> OAuth2 or OpenID Connect identity providers: Google, Microsoft and Yahoo account for over 90% of the US market, according to a data analysis conducted by <a href="https://blog.mailchimp.com/major-email-provider-trends-in-2015-gmail-takes-a-really-big-lead/">MailChimp in 2015</a>. These providers already have the ability to assert proof of access in the form of <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken">ID tokens</a>. Providing an easier mechanism to acquire such ID tokens would simplify authentication for many services.</p></div></section><section id="credential-managers"><h3 id="rfc.section.1.4"><a href="#rfc.section.1.4">1.4.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#credential-managers">Credential managers</a></h3><div id="rfc.section.1.4.p.1"><p>A <em>credential manager</em> is a piece of software that remembers credentials on behalf of a user. Most credential managers focus on password based authentication, and offer to generate strong, unique password for each new service a user interacts with.</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.4.p.2"><p>The most common credential manager that users encounter is their web browser, which presents itself via form-fill on authentication pages. Technically knowledgeable users often also have a standalone credential manager.</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.4.p.3" class="avoidbreakafter"><p>Credential managers suffer from the following usability issues, which limit their appeal:</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.4.p.4"><ul><li><div><p>When a credential manager is a standalone application, the user must manually switch context to find the relevant credential, and copy-paste it to the service they are signing in to. Browser extensions can make this easier, but are not supported on all platforms, in particular on mobile devices.</p></div> <div><p>Manually copying a password also represents a security risk in itself; on some platforms it is possible for other applications installed on the device to monitor the clipboard and steal passwords that are copied out of the credential manager.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>Where a credential manager is able to integrate with the browser or OS in some way, heuristics are often necessary to detect and fill in login forms. Such heuristics are fragile to changes in the service, such as when they are redesigned or change path within the domain. Heuristics are employed because there is rarely any viable alternative: services do not provide sufficient information for a credential manager to do a better job.</p></div> <div><p>This problem is particularly acute when the login system employs an <em>identifier first</em> pattern, where collection of the identifier and a password are split across separate screens. In such situations, heuristics typically fail to detect the relationship between the fields across these separate screens.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>Credential managers are often blind to relationships between apps and sites that share the same authentication system - saving a credential for one site does not automatically make this credential available on other, related sites.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>Credential managers do not assist federated authentication: they cannot help the user remember if they signed in to the service using Google or Facebook, only whether they filled in an identifier and password.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>Credential managers are unaware of password restrictions in use on the site: how long they must be, whether they must include a number or symbol, etc. As such, <em>password generation</em> is also heuristic and based on a least common denominator schema that is acceptable to the majority of services.</p></div><a class="self" href="#rfc.section.1.4.p.4">¶</a></li> </ul></div></section><section id="solution-direct-communication-with-a-credential-manager"><h3 id="rfc.section.1.5"><a href="#rfc.section.1.5">1.5.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#solution-direct-communication-with-a-credential-manager">Solution: Direct communication with a credential manager</a></h3><div id="rfc.section.1.5.p.1" class="avoidbreakafter"><p>If services could directly communicate with the user's preferred credential manager, manual authentication and its associated problems can completely disappear. If such a communication channel existed, then the following operations would be possible:</p></div><div id="rfc.section.1.5.p.2"><ul><li><div><p>Account creation facilitated by the credential manager. The service could describe to the credential manager what authentication methods it supports, and what password restrictions it has. In response, a credential provider could (with or without user assistance) select an email address and generate a strong, unique password that is guaranteed to work.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>Automatic retrieval of existing credentials. At the appropriate moment, a service could request a credential, and have this automatically returned, or returned after some in-context user consent is solicited. This would be a marked improvement over the user manually finding and copying the credential, and minimizes the opportunity for the credential to be stolen in doing so.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>Maintenance of the credential manager store. When the service modifies an account, it can notify the credential manager of account changes. This information can be used to keep the credential store fresh.</p></div></li> <li><div><p>"Proof of access" to email addresses and phone numbers (as described in the <a href="#account-recovery-based-authentication" title="Account recovery based authentication">Section&nbsp;1.3</a> section above) could be directly solicited.
